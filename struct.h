/*
   struct .h

   Contains all structs and methods for working with the
   /proc directory.
   You will use only the structs Job and Root really,
   the struct Knot is only there to combine these.
   I am using a single joined chain to store the Jobs.

   every Job has 
   	char * name   		wich describes the name of the program
	unsigned int pid 	wich is his pid
	unsigned int ppid	wich is his ppid
	unsigned int uid	the uid of the user wich started the job
	//this is currently the first field in the status file
	char status		the status of the job
   this is nearly everything tha we usually may use.
